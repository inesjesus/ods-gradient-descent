# Semi-Supervised Learning using Gradient Descent Methods

This project consists of using the classic Gradient Descent and the Block Coordinate Gradient Descent with both Randomized rule and Gauss-Southwell rule to perform semi-supervised learning tasks. The tasks are binary detection in a randomly generated two-dimensional binary dataset, a Breast Cancer Prediction dataset and a Water Quality Prediction dataset, in which only a small sample of the data is labeled. 

Performances are compared using loss and accuracy againt CPU time and number of iterations.
